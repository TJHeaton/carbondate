\subsection{\code{walker_example_output}}{

A list with 11 items, as described in \link{WalkerBivarDirichlet}. In
this case \eqn{n_{\textrm{out}}} is 501 and \eqn{n_{\textrm{obs}}} is 255.

\description{
This output has been provided for trying out the plotting and summarisation
functions without having to first run a calibration. It shows the output from
running \link{WalkerBivarDirichlet} with the \link{kerr}
radiocarbon input data and the \link{intcal20} calibration curve for
100,000 iterations. To reduce file size a large \eqn{n_{\textrm{thin}} = 100}
was used and the first half of the observations where discarded.
