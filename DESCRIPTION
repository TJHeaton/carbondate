Description: 
  Performs Bayesian non-parametric calibration of multiple related radiocarbon 
  determinations, and summarises the calendar age information to plot their joint calendar age density
  (see <doi:10.1111/rssc.12599> Timothy J. Heaton (2022)).
  Also models the occurrence of radiocarbon samples as a variable-rate (inhomogeneous) Poisson process,
  plotting the posterior estimate for the occurrence rate of the samples over calendar time, and providing 
  information about potential change points.
